## 🧶 About the Brand

> _“Every thread carries the wisdom of generations, every stitch tells a story of love.”_

**Aqshmar** began when three sisters — Maryam, Aqsa, and Ayesha — discovered their grandmother’s embroidery chest. Inspired by its patterns and memories, they vowed to preserve this art through a clothing line that respects tradition and speaks to today’s aesthetic.

Each t-shirt is a product of **15+ hours of hand embroidery**, with patterns rooted in heritage and designed for timeless expression.
